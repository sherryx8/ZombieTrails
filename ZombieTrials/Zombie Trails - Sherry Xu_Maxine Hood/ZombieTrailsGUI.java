* Game summary: There's been a zombie apocalypse and the user is infected. They have 720 hrs (30 days)
* to get to Oregon where a lab can cure them. There is a set path of cities they go through and 2 random events
* between each city. At the begining of the game they choose their supplies and their choces throughout the 
* game affects the supplies. If a supply hits 0 or below or they are killed by a random event it's game over.
