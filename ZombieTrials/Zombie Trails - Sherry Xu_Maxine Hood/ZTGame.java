/**
* ZTGame.java
* A part of the Zombie Trails game created for Wellesley's CS230 end project. 
* This program is the second page of the game. The player sees their stats and different events pop
* up which prompt them to make a decision. Their decision affects their stats and can cause them 
* to win or lose the game. Winning or losing directs them to a different panel.
* 
* Maxine Hood and Sherry Xu were primarily responsible for it's implementation (both did half).
